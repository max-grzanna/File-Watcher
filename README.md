# File-Watcher

This is a tool in the context of [paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx). 
It`s purpose is watching a directory  for new files, use OCRMyPdf to create a text layer via optical character 
recognition and send the file to a destination directory.

One can use it to automate ocr-ing scanned PDF`s and feeding a PDF/A document to the consumer directory of paperless.
Configuration can be found in config.toml.
